# Biography

I am an applied statistician based at the <a href="http://adri-shanghai.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asian Demographic Research Institute</a> and [IIASA](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Introduction.html). I am also a Professor in the <a href="http://en.shu.edu.cn/Default.aspx?tabid=26181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Sociology and Political Science</a> at Shanghai University. Previously, I worked at the <a href="http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vienna Institute of Demography</a>, the <a href="http://www.cpc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESRC Centre for Population Change</a> and <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/s3ri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S3RI</a> at the University of Southampton.

My day-to-day research covers estimating migration and applying statistical methods to better forecast components of population change. This website contains random posts on <a href="http://gjabel.wordpress.com/category/r/">R</a>, <a href="http://gjabel.wordpress.com/category/bugs/">BUGS</a> and <a href="http://gjabel.wordpress.com/category/latex/">LaTeX</a> code, as well as some information on my <a href="https://gjabel.wordpress.com/journal-publications/">publications</a>.

My work contact details are in my relatively up to date <a href="http://www.wittgensteincentre.org/Jacomo/upload/team/cv-abel-march-2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CV</a>.
