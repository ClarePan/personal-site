I gave a presentation on the method developed during my MS.c. at <a href="http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/gja104/POPFEST07/">POPFEST 2007</a>. This also included some new results for estimating flows in 7 non-census years (only two were estimated in the <a title="Combining census and registration data to estimate detailed elderly migration flows in England and Wales" href="http://gjabel.wordpress.com/2010/08/05/combining-census-and-registration-data-to-estimate-detailed-elderly-migration-flows-in-england-and-wales/">paper</a>).

The longer series of estimates allows a better comparison of migration flows over time, as well as allowing for some better visualisations of the results. The slides (my first attempt at using Beamer) are available on the conference website <a href="//popfest2007.socstats.soton.ac.uk/Guy_Abel.pdf">here</a>.
