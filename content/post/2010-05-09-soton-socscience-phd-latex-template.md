This is a LaTeX Template based on the code used for my Thesis.tex document submitted in the School of Social Sciences, University of Southampton (April 2009). I had to develop this myself as I (and others in my Ph.D. cohort) had no contact with previous LaTeX users from the school.
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><a href="https://gist.github.com/gjabel/9574156#file-thesis-tex"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-119" title="tex" src="http://gjabel.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/tex1.png" alt="" width="51" height="51" /></a> This is the raw .tex file. I have cut out most of the text to leave the bones of the LaTeX commands. (Click on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsley_Royal">Kingsley Royal</a> LaTeX icon). The entire thesis is available online, link in this <a href="http://gjabel.wordpress.com/international-migration/" title="International Migration Estimation">post</a>.</p>

I tried to keep within the formatting <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/quality/framework/research_completion.html">guidelines</a> laid out in the Completion  of Research Degree Candidature book of the University of Southampton and did not receive any problems in my viva.

Feel free to use this as a template. Let me know if you add any developments and I will update the template accordingly.
